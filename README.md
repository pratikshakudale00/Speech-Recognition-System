##üöÄ Project Overview
As part of my internship at Codetech Solutions, I was assigned my second task: to build a Speech Recognition System using Python. The goal was to create a tool that listens to audio input via a microphone and converts spoken words into text in real-time. This gave me hands-on exposure to speech-to-text technologies and helped broaden my skills in audio processing and Python programming.

üèÜ Key Learnings & Implementation Details
Core Speech Recognition Flow


Used the speech_recognition library to capture live audio from the default microphone.

Implemented r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source) to calibrate for background noise and improve accuracy.

Audio Listening & Recognition

Used r.listen(source) to record the user‚Äôs voice.

Applied the recognize_google() method to convert speech into text using Google‚Äôs Web Speech API.

Robust Error Handling

Managed UnknownValueError for unclear speech.

Caught RequestError to handle issues like network failures or API issues.

Development Environment

Developed and tested in IDLE (Python 32-bit), focusing primarily on the core logic of speech capture and recognition.

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x (IDLE ‚Äì 32‚Äëbit)

speech_recognition library

Google Web Speech API (default recognizer)

YouTube tutorials and ChatGPT ‚Äî for concept exploration, debugging, and clarifying API calls
